Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
==========================================

Implemented these two Machine Learning algorithms while studying CS 189 @ UC Berkeley.

Project Outline:

- `classifier.py` - machine learning code of LDA and QDA
- `learn-spam.py` - example code running spam email classification
- `data/features.mat` - matlab file containing training data
  + each row represents an email labeled as either "spam" or "ham"
  + each col represents frequency of a word in this email
- `data/features.obj` - python pickle file containing dictionary of words

The data files are not included in this github repo, they can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6w5do8nvydov549/AAAcgs4vUwY7vnmrNn9EfeqZa?dl=0).
